Membership:

We need to nail down membership.  Probably remove the cooks membership



* one manager window and subclass it 
* position of windows
* size of windows
* just one singleton and subclass it
* suss NSDate vs. NSCalendarDate

* in invoice controller
  make sure to do special handling of donations
  and make the donation object uneditable in the product manager.


TODO:

* when deleting a person:
   remove contacts, invoices, comments, credits, projects
   archive person
